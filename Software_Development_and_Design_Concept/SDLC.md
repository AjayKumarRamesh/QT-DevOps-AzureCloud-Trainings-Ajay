Software Development & Design Concept
---------------------------------------
### SDLC Process:
  * Analysis/Requirements: Requirements Document
  * Design:
     * HLD (High Level Design)
     * LLD (Low Level Design)
     * Test Case Design
  * Implementation:
     * Code => Version Control System (git)     
  * Testing:
     * Test Results   
  * Deployment: Live to customer/ production
  * Maintenance:
     * Support portal   


### Scrum:
* Requirements Document `=>` Product Backlog
* Product Backlogs `=>` sprint backlog
* Sprint formalities
   * Sprint Planning
   * Standup meeting
   * Sprint Demo
   * Sprint retrospective
* Jira Kanban Boards
  * Scrum Board
* Charts:
   * Sprint Burn down chart  

### Web Applications
  * To run a web application there are two factors
     * client
     * server

  * Types of Web Applications:
     * Mutli page (Traditional):
        * Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery  
     * Single Page Application (SPA):
       * Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular js, react js, vue js    

### Proxy Servers:
* proxy servers act as intermediate between client and other servers
* proxy servers means it will help us to restrict the access some website from our organization network
* in our organization all our system is connected to one network and we will put proxy server for that network, so this proxy server will allow only limited access to website rest all will get error page saying that your not allowed to access this website.
* **There are two types of proxy servers:**
     * **forward proxy server:**
        * it will help us in restricting the website
     * **reverse proxy server:**
       * it will act as loadbalancing and it is useful for loadbalancing
